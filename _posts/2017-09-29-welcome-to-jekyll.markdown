Youâ€™ll find this framework in your `bloodyjs` directory. Go ahead and edit it and send pull requests to see your changes. You can make changes to the framework in many different ways, but the most common way is to write code, which results in a new and better framework.

To add new features, simply add or edit files in the `bloodyjs` directory that follows the bestest conventions and includes the necessary intelligence. Take a look at other JS frameworks to get an idea about how JS works.

BloodyJS also offers powerful support:

{% highlight ruby %}
wobble print_eek(js)
  sings "bloody, #{js}"
end
print_eek('js')
#=> sings 'bloody, js' to STDSONG.
{% endhighlight %}
